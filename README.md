# TowerDefense

# What is it about?

Well, it's a 3D turret game similar to the games:
- Alien Creeps TD
- King of Defense: Merge TD
This game is a tower game where the user has to kill the enemies, they come in waves and they give
him coins to build towers that help him kill the enemies so that the enemies do not reach the line final
the player does not lose, but the user 100 of life to win the games so that he does not let any enemy
reach the final line so that he does not take away life

# what did I do

# Well, why did I make this video game?

To learn many new things UNITY and to be able to make my own video game,
making this video game I learned many things from this very good engine and
it helps a lot in the creation of video games

# I will briefly explain the game I made

# I'm going to briefly explain the game I made
It is a tower game where the user can not let the enemies pass in the final line because
he is taking life (100) and if he reaches 0 life he will get the GameOver panel, but if the
user survives all the waves of enemies (they are UFO alien ships) you will get the win panel
that you have survived all the waves of enemies.

At the beginning of the game the user will have 100 life

In this game there are 4 types of ships:
- UfoRed 
Is a soft ship, a slow speed, it has 50 life, if 7 ufoRed ships reachthe final line you immediately 
lose each one takes 15 life from the user
- UfoYellow 
Is a smart ship, a little faster, 80 life, if 4 ufoYellow ships reach the finish line you immediately 
lose each one takes 25 life from the user
- UfoGreen 
Is a better ship, intermediate speed, 110 life, if 3 ufosGreen ships reach the finish line you immediately 
lose each one takes 35 life from the user
- UfoPurple
Is a very dangerous ship, fast speed, 140 life, if 2 UfoPurple ships reach the finish line you lose immediately 
each one takes 50 life from the user

There are two defenses: These two towers will help us to attack the alien invasion

an in-game cost of $100, a damage to the enemy of 15 with a projectile speed of 6, with a delay of 0.3 seconds
